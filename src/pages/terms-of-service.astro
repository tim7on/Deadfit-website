			<h1>Terms of Service for Deadfit</h1>
			<p class='text-gray-400'><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

			<p>
				Welcome to Deadfit! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your
				use of the Deadfit mobile application (the "Service"). By
				accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
				Terms.
			</p>

			<h2>1. Health & Medical Disclaimer</h2>
			<p>
				The Service is intended for fitness and educational purposes
				only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
				You should consult a healthcare professional before beginning
				any new fitness program. You voluntarily assume all known and
				unknown risks associated with fitness activities, even if caused
				in whole or part by the action or inaction of Deadfit.
			</p>

			<h2>2. User Content</h2>
			<p>
				All content you create within the app, including workout logs,
				progress, and other data ("User Content"), is stored locally on
				your device. We do not have access to this User Content. You are
				solely responsible for maintaining and backing up your User
				Content.
			</p>

			<h2>3. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
			<p>
				The Service may include optional in-app purchases or
				subscriptions ("Purchases") that unlock additional features. All
				Purchases are managed and processed through the platform on
				which you downloaded the app (e.g., Apple App Store or Google
				Play Store).
			</p>
			<p>
				You are responsible for all charges associated with your
				Purchases. If you subscribe to a recurring plan, it will
				auto-renew unless you cancel it through your platform's
				subscription management settings.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Prohibited Uses</h2>
			<p>
				You may not use the Service to attempt to decompile or reverse
				engineer any software contained in the app or for any purpose
				that is unlawful.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Termination</h2>
			<p>
				We may terminate or suspend your access to our Service for any
				reason, including if you breach the Terms. As your User Content
				is stored locally, it will remain on your device unless you
				choose to delete it.
			</p>

			<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
			<p>
				In no event shall Deadfit be liable for any indirect,
				incidental, special, or consequential damages, including
				personal injury or loss of data, resulting from your access to
				or use of the Service.
			</p>

			<h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any
				time. We will aim to provide reasonable notice prior to any new
				terms taking effect.
			</p>
