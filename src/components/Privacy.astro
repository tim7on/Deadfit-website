		<h1>Privacy Policy for Deadfit</h1>
		<p class='text-gray-500'>
			<strong>Last Updated:</strong> 22 September 2025
		</p>

		<p>
			Welcome to Deadfit. Your privacy is a top priority for us. This
			policy explains what information is collected and why.
		</p>

		<h2>Core Principle: Your Fitness Data is Stored Locally</h2>
		<p>
			All of your personal fitness data—including workout logs, exercises,
			sets, reps, weight lifted, and any notes you enter—is stored
			exclusively on your device.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong
				>We, the developers of Deadfit, do not have servers to store
				this personal data, and we cannot access it.</strong
			> It never leaves your control.
		</p>

		<h2>1. What Data is Collected and Why</h2>
		<p>
			While your personal fitness data stays on your device, we use two
			industry-standard third-party services to improve the app and manage
			purchases. These services collect anonymous or non-personal data.
		</p>

		<h3>A. Anonymous Usage Analytics (Google Analytics for Firebase)</h3>
		<p>
			We use Google Analytics for Firebase to understand how users
			interact with our app. This helps us identify which features are
			popular, find and fix bugs, and make the app better for everyone.
			This service collects
			<strong>anonymous, aggregated data</strong>, such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The number of users who open the app.</li>
			<li>Which screens are viewed and how often.</li>
			<li>General session duration.</li>
			<li>
				Broad demographic information (e.g., country, device language).
			</li>
			<li>App crash reports.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Crucially, this analytics data is <strong
				>not linked to your personal identity or your specific fitness
				logs</strong
			>. You can learn more about how Google handles data in its <a
				href='https://policies.google.com/privacy'
				target='_blank'
				rel='noopener noreferrer'>privacy policy</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h3>B. In-App Purchase Management (RevenueCat)</h3>
		<p>
			To offer and manage in-app purchases or subscriptions (e.g., Deadfit
			Pro), we use a service called RevenueCat. When you make a purchase,
			RevenueCat handles the receipt validation with the Apple App Store
			or Google Play Store. To do this, it collects:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				An anonymous, randomly generated user ID to associate with your
				purchase status.
			</li>
			<li>
				Purchase history and subscription status (e.g., active,
				expired).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This allows us to verify your purchase and unlock premium features
			within the app. RevenueCat <strong>does not</strong> have access to your
			payment details (like credit card numbers) or your personal fitness data.
			You can view their privacy policy <a
				href='https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy'
				target='_blank'
				rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h2>2. Data Security & Retention</h2>
		<p>
			Your personal fitness data is secured by your device's operating
			system. You can delete it at any time by clearing the app's data or
			uninstalling the app. Anonymous data collected by our third-party
			services is subject to their respective retention policies.
		</p>

		<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
		<p>
			Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
			knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone
			under 13.
		</p>

		<h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
			you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
			and updating the "Last Updated" date.
		</p>
