			Welcome to Deadfit. Your privacy is a top priority for us. This
			policy explains what information is collected, what isn't, and why.

			routes, steps, and distance—is stored <strong
				>exclusively on your device</strong

			data, and we cannot access it. It never leaves your control.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the data that is
			collected to run the service, your rights, and how the law protects
			you. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of
			information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
